Welcome to EECE3624 - Microprocessors: Principles and Applications.

This is the top level repo for all of the EECE3624 Labs.  After you check-out this 
initial repo from the GitHubs Classroom Link, you will get initial starter code
for your 1st lab.  To check-in your code, you just need to follow the normal
get process of
  - add (for any newly created files)
  - commit (to register all changes to your local sandbox)
    - NOTE:  commits should be done often during development.
      Any time you have a new piece of code or a new function
      you would be sad to lose, commit!
  - push (to sync your latest commit to the cloud repo)
    - This can be done often, but must be done once when you
      have final code for professor review.

For the next lab, I will update the top level repo with a new folder.  You will 
need to "fetch" these new bits to be ready for the next lab.
  - NOTE:  "fetching" will NOT erase anything you have checked in from other
    lab "pushes".
